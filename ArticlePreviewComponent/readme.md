# Article Preview Component

This project is a solution to the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/article-preview-component-dYBN_pYFT) **Article Preview Component** challenge.  
It is built using **HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript**, fully responsive, and features an interactive sharing functionality.

## What I Learned

While building this project, I improved my skills in:

- **Semantic HTML:** Using tags like `<article>`, `<time>`, and `<button>` for better accessibility and SEO.
- **Modern CSS:** Building a design system using **CSS Variables** (Custom Properties) for consistent color management.
- **Flexbox & Positioning:** Mastering alignment and using `position: absolute` with `z-index` to create the interactive tooltip.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Implementing a "toggle" functionality to show and hide the social media share menu.
- **Responsive Design:** Using **Media Queries** to transition smoothly from a mobile-first layout to a desktop side-by-side view.

## Reflection

This challenge was instrumental in deepening my understanding of how to manage layouts that change significantly between mobile and desktop. Specifically, handling the "share" state helped me practice positioning elements relative to their containers and managing the visual hierarchy when UI elements overlap.
