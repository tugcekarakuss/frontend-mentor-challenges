# Simple Omelette Recipe Page

This project is a **[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io)** challenge: a simple, responsive recipe page built with HTML and CSS.

## 🌟 What I Learned

During this project, I practiced and improved my skills in:

- Styling `ul` and `li` lists using **`::marker`**.
- Using **margin and padding** to control spacing and layout.
- Aligning elements responsively with **flexbox** and `align-self`.
- Implementing responsive font sizes with `clamp()` and `calc()`.
- Using `<hr>` and borders to separate content sections.
