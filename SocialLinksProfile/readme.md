## 🎨 Customization

The original challenge provided a base design, and I personalized it with:  
- 👤 My own personal details (name, location, job title)  
- 🔗 Links to my own profiles (LinkedIn, GitHub, Figma, Portfolio, Frontend Mentor)  
- 🎨 A custom color palette using CSS variables  
- 🔤 A custom font setup (`@font-face` with Inter)  
- ✨ Extra improvements like `clamp()`, `transition`, and responsive tweaks

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to use CSS variables (`:root`) for consistent theming  
- Improving responsive typography with `clamp()`  
- Making links fully clickable by using `display: block` on `<a>` elements  
- Cleaner spacing using Flexbox and the `gap` property  
- The importance of semantic HTML for better accessibility
