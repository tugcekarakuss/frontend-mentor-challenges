## 🌟 What I Learned

In working on this project, I:  
- Built a responsive card layout using **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**  
- Defined a scalable **design system** using CSS variables (colors, typography)  
- Created fluid, responsive typography with the `clamp()` function  
- Applied an image overlay effect using `mix‑blend‑mode: multiply`  
- Managed different `border‑radius` settings for desktop vs mobile  
- Used mobile‑first breakpoints to ensure the design works across devices
